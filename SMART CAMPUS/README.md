### 6. Running the System in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

You have **TWO** ways to run the project depending on your preference:

#### **Option A: Web-Based Version (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java Backend, SQLite Database)**

1. Open the `KingsQueensUniversity` folder in VS Code.
2. Ensure you have the **"Extension Pack for Java"** installed in VS Code.
3. Open `src/main/java/com/kqu/web/WebServer.java`.
4. Click **"Run"** above `public static void main(String[] args)` (or press the green Play button).
5. Open your web browser and go to:
   👉 **`http://localhost:8080`**
6. Alternatively, in the VS Code integrated terminal (`Ctrl + ~`):
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     chmod +x run-web.sh && ./run-web.sh
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     run-web.bat
     ```

*Note:* You can also open `web/index.html` directly or with VS Code's "Live Server" extension to inspect the frontend interface!

#### **Option B: Java Desktop Application (Swing GUI + SQLite Database)**

1. Open `src/main/java/com/kqu/Main.java`.
2. Click **"Run"** above `public static void main(String[] args)`.
3. The desktop GUI window will launch directly on your screen.

### 7. Compilation & Execution via Terminal (Manual)
```bash
# 1. Compile all Java source files
javac -d bin src/main/java/com/kqu/*.java src/main/java/com/kqu/*/*.java

# 2. Run Web Edition (HTML/CSS/JS + Java Web Server + SQLite)
java -cp bin com.kqu.web.WebServer

# OR Run Desktop Edition (Swing GUI)
java -cp bin com.kqu.Main
```
